Hello! My name is Anastasis Papanagnou and I'm a Computer Vision Engineer. My main focus as a Research Engineer is Computer Vision in a Human-centered perspective. To be more specific, in my latest role I have used human detection/segmentation tools and developed a Person Re-identification module, in order to identify someone that has re-entered a scene.  I am confident with my Deep Learning and coding skills and willing to research on new AI applications.
